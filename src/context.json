Job Name: -- /381449t Breast 349 32 INTRODUCTION This staging system for carcinoma of the breast applies to inva- sive (also designated in\ufb01 ltrating) as well as in situ carcinomas, with or without microinvasion. Microscopic con\ufb01 rmation of the diagnosis is mandatory, and the histologic type and grade of carcinoma should be recorded. For all sites (T, N, M), clinical staging (c) is determined using information identi\ufb01 ed prior to surgery or neoadjuvant therapy. Pathologic staging (p) includes information de\ufb01 ned at surgery. With neoadju- vant therapy a posttherapy pathologic staging is recorded using the \u201cyp\u201d designator. The year 2009 marks the 50th anniversary of codi\ufb01 ca- tion of tumor staging into the TNM system by the Ameri- can Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; originally designated the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and End- Results Reporting).\nDesignation should be made with the subscript \u201cc\u201d or \u201cp\u201d modi\ufb01 er to indicate whether the T classi\ufb01 cation was determined by clinical (physical examination or radiologic) or pathologic measurements, respectively. In general, pathologic determination should take precedence over clinical determination of T size.

Clinical (pretreatment) T will be de\ufb01 ned by clinical and radiographic \ufb01 ndings, while y pathologic (posttreat- ment) T will be determined by pathologic size and extension. The ypT will be measured as the largest single focus of invasive tumor, with the modi\ufb01 er \u201cm\u201d indicating multiple foci. The mea- surement of the largest tumor focus should not include areas of \ufb01 brosis within the tumor bed.\nThe M category for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy is the category assigned in the clinical stage, prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.

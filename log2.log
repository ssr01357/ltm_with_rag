AFS = frozen section, A1. - A2 = remaining tissue,. Part B is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient\'s name and "R breast lumpectomy". It consists of a. piece of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue measuring 10.5 X 9.0 x 6,0 cm. An ellipse of skin is not present. An X-ray is. received. A localization needle is not noted. A short suture is noted indicating the superior margin and a row of long. sutures are noted indicating the lateral margin. A mass is palpated in the center. The superficial surface is inked yellow. and the deep surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned.

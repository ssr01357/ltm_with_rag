 Tumor (T)
 ● Identiﬁ ed speciﬁ c imaging modalities that can be used to estimate clinical tumor size, 
including mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  
 ● Made speciﬁ c recommendations that (1) the microscopic measurement is the most 
accurate and preferred method to determine pT with a small invasive cancer that can 
be entirely submitted in one parafﬁ n block, and (2) the gross measurement is the most 
accurate and preferred method to determine pT with larger invasive cancers that must 
be submitted in multiple parafﬁ n blocks  
 ● Made the speciﬁ c recommendation to use the clinical measurement thought to be most 
accurate to determine the clinical T of breast cancers treated with neoadjuvant therapy. 
Pathologic (posttreatment) size should be estimated based on the best combination of 
gross and microscopic histological ﬁ ndings 
 ● Made the speciﬁ c recommendation to estimate the size of invasive cancers that are unap-
parent to any clinical modalities or gross pathologic examination by carefully measuring 
and recording the relative positions of tissue samples submitted for microscopic evalua-
tion and determining which contain tumor 
 ● Acknowledged “ductal intraepithelial neoplasia” (DIN) as uncommon, and still not 
widely accepted, terminology encompassing both DCIS and ADH, and clariﬁ cation that 
only cases referred to as DIN containing DCIS (±ADH) are classiﬁ ed as Tis (DCIS) 
 ● Acknowledged “lobular intraepithelial neoplasia” (LIN) as uncommon, and still not 
widely accepted, terminology encompassing both LCIS and ALH, and clariﬁ cation that 
only cases referred to as LIN containing LCIS (±ALH) are classiﬁ ed as Tis (LCIS) 
 ● Clariﬁ cation that only Paget’s disease NOT associated with an underlying noninvasive 
(i.e., DCIS and/or LCIS) or invasive breast cancer should be classiﬁ ed as Tis (Paget’s) and 
that Paget’s disease associated with an underlying cancer be classiﬁ ed according to the 
underlying cancer (Tis, T1, etc.) 
 ● Made the recommendation to estimate the size of noninvasive carcinomas (DCIS and 
LCIS), even though it does not currently change their T classiﬁ cation, because noninvasive 
cancer size may inﬂ uence therapeutic decisions, acknowledging that providing a precise 
size for LCIS may be difﬁ cult 
 ● Acknowledged that the prognosis of microinvasive carcinoma is generally thought to be 
quite favorable, although the clinical impact of multifocal microinvasive disease is not 
well understood at this time 
 ● Acknowledged that it is not necessary for tumors to be in separate quadrants to be clas-
siﬁ ed as multiple simultaneous ipsilateral carcinomas, providing that they can be unam-
biguously demonstrated to be macroscopically distinct and measurable using available 
clinical and pathologic techniques

SUMMARY OF CHANGES (CONTINUED)
 ● Maintained that the term “inﬂ ammatory carcinoma” be restricted to cases with typical 
skin changes involving a third or more of the skin of the breast. While the histologic 
presence of invasive carcinoma invading dermal lymphatics is supportive of the diagno-
sis, it is not required, nor is dermal lymphatic invasion without typical clinical ﬁ ndings 
sufﬁ cient for a diagnosis of inﬂ ammatory breast cancer 
 ● Recommend that all invasive cancer should be graded using the Nottingham combined 
histologic grade (Elston-Ellis modiﬁ cation of Scarff–Bloom–Richardson grading system)  
 Nodes (N)
 ● Classiﬁ cation of isolated tumor cell clusters and single cells is more stringent. Small 
clusters of cells not greater than 0.2 mm, or nonconﬂ uent or nearly conﬂ uent clusters of 
cells not exceeding 200 cells in a single histologic lymph node cross section are classiﬁ ed 
as isolated tumor cells 
 ● Use of the (sn) modiﬁ er has been clariﬁ ed and restricted. When six or more sentinel 
nodes are identiﬁ ed on gross examination of pathology specimens the (sn) modiﬁ er 
should be omitted 
 ● Stage I breast tumors have been subdivided into Stage IA and Stage IB; Stage IB includes 
small tumors (T1) with exclusively micrometastases in lymph nodes (N1mi)    
 Metastases (M)
 ● Created new M0(i+) category, deﬁ ned by presence of either disseminated tumor cells detect-
able in bone marrow or circulating tumor cells or found incidentally in other tissues (such as 
ovaries removed prophylactically) if not exceeding 0.2 mm. However, this category does not 
change the Stage Grouping. Assuming that they do not have clinically and/or radiographi-
cally detectable metastases, patients with M0(i+) are staged according to T and N  
 Postneoadjuvant Therapy (yc or ypTNM)
 ● In the setting of patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, pretreatment clinical T (cT) 
should be based on clinical or imaging ﬁ ndings 
 ● Postneoadjuvant therapy T should be based on clinical or imaging (ycT) or pathologic 
ﬁ ndings (ypT) 
 ● A subscript will be added to the clinical N for both node negative and node positive 
patients to indicate whether the N was derived from clinical examination, ﬁ ne needle 
aspiration, core needle biopsy, or sentinel lymph node biopsy  
 ● The posttreatment ypT will be defined as the largest contiguous focus of invasive 
cancer as defined histopathologically with a subscript to indicate the presence of 
multiple tumor foci. Note: deﬁ nition of posttreatment ypT remains controversial and 
an area in transition 
 ● Posttreatment nodal metastases no greater than 0.2 mm are classiﬁ ed as ypN0(i+) as in 
patients who have not received neoadjuvant systemic therapy. However, patients with 
this ﬁ nding are not considered to have achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) 
 ● A description of the degree of response to neoadjuvant therapy (complete, partial, no 
response) will be collected by the registrar with the posttreatment ypTNM. The registrars 
are requested to describe how they deﬁ ned response [by physical examination, imaging tech-
niques (mammogram, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) or pathologically]  
 ● Patients will be considered to have M1 (and therefore Stage IV) breast cancer if they have 
had clinically or radiographically detectable metastases, with or without biopsy, prior to 
neoadjuvant systemic therapy, regardless of their status after neoadjuvant systemic therapy

 INTRODUCTION 
 This staging system for carcinoma of the breast applies to inva-
sive (also designated inﬁ ltrating) as well as in situ carcinomas, 
with or without microinvasion. Microscopic conﬁ rmation of 
the diagnosis is mandatory, and the histologic type and grade 
of carcinoma should be recorded. For all sites (T, N, M), 
clinical staging (c) is determined using information identiﬁ ed 
prior to surgery or neoadjuvant therapy. Pathologic staging 
(p) includes information deﬁ ned at surgery. With neoadju-
vant therapy a posttherapy pathologic staging is recorded 
using the “yp” designator. 
 The year 2009 marks the 50th anniversary of codiﬁ ca-
tion of tumor staging into the TNM system by the Ameri-
can Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; originally designated 
the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and End-
Results Reporting). Beginning with that initiative, six editions 
of the AJCC Staging Manual have been published, in which 
careful deﬁ nitions of the primary tumor (T), the status of the 
surrounding lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant

 ** T0 and T1 tumors with nodal micrometastases only are excluded from Stage IIA and are classiﬁ ed Stage IB.
 ● M0 includes M0(i+). 
 ● The designation pM0 is not valid; any M0 should be clinical. 
 ● If a patient presents with M1 prior to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the stage is considered stage IV and remains stage 
IV regardless of response to neoadjuvant therapy. 
 ● Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studies reveal the presence of distant metastases, provided 
that the studies are carried out within 4 months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression and provided that 
the patient has not received neoadjuvant therapy. 
 ● Postneoadjuvant therapy is designated with “yc” or “yp” preﬁ x. Of note, no stage group is assigned if there is a complete 
pathologic response (CR) to neoadjuvant therapy, for example, ypT0ypN0cM0. 
 PROGNOSTIC FEATURES 
 New biomarkers are added and recommended for collection in addition to hormone receptors 
(estrogen receptor, ER; progesterone receptor, PgR). These are HER2 (also designated as erbB2 
and c-neu) status and multigene signature “score” or classiﬁ cations.

metastases have been reﬁ ned to reﬂ ect updates in technol-
ogy and clinical evidence. 1 In each case, changes in the TNM 
system were made cautiously, so as to reﬂ ect modern clinical 
approaches while maintaining connections with the past. The 
recommendations by the Breast Cancer Task Force for the 
seventh edition are made in the same spirit. 
 Rapid advances in both clinical and laboratory science and 
in translational research have raised questions about the ongo-
ing relevance of TNM staging, especially in breast cancer. For 
the most part, the TNM system was developed in 1959 in the 
absence of effective systemic therapy and certainly in a void of 
the understanding of the biology of breast cancer that exists 
today. The system was generated to reﬂ ect the risk of distant 
recurrence and death subsequent to local therapy, which at the 
time was almost universally aggressive surgery (radical mastec-
tomy) and postoperative radiation to the chest wall. Therefore, 
the primary objective of TNM staging was to provide a stan-
dard nomenclature for prognosis of patients with newly diag-
nosed breast cancer, and its main clinical utility was to prevent 
apparently futile therapy in those patients who were destined 
to die rapidly in spite of aggressive local treatments. 
 Over the succeeding decades, remarkable progress has 
led to (1) less disﬁ guring surgery with modiﬁ ed radical 
mastectomies and breast conserving therapy, (2) dramatic 
improvements in the delivery and safety of radiation, (3) the 
recognition that early (adjuvant) systemic therapy reduces 
recurrences and mortality, and (4) a better understanding 
of biologic markers of prognosis, and perhaps more impor-
tantly, of prediction of response to selective categories of 
systemic therapy, such as those targeting cancer cells positive 
for estrogen receptors (ER) and HER2 overexpression. 2 TNM 
staging has been used as a guide to select whether to apply 
systemic therapy based on anatomic prognosis. Increasingly, 
biologic factors, such as ER and HER2, have become impor-
tant to select which therapy to give. 
 These advances raise the questions: Is TNM staging still 
relevant for breast cancer in the twenty-ﬁ rst century and 
what, exactly, is the objective of TNM staging for patients 
with this disease? There are three potential answers to the 
second question: (1) To permit breast cancer investigators to 
remain linked to the past, in regards to studying categories of 
patients that accurately reﬂ ect prior groupings over the last 
six decades, (2) to permit current investigators in the ﬁ eld 
to communicate with one another in the same manner, and/
or (3) to improve individual patient care. The AJCC Breast 
Cancer Task force has struggled with these questions, both 
for the seventh edition as well as for past editions. Indeed, 
the Breast Cancer Task Force made a major change from the 
ﬁ fth edition to the sixth edition in recommending that the 
N staging category be divided into three categories based on 
the number of axillary lymph nodes involved. In this regard, 
the current Breast Cancer Task Force came to the conclu-
sion that although the TNM staging system provides insight 
into whether a patient’s prognosis is so favorable the patient 
might forego systemic therapy, it is becoming anachronistic 
with regard to making recommendations for speciﬁ c types of 
systemic therapy. 
 Although T, N, and M do still provide some value in 
determining a patient’s future outcome, the average clinician 
today must take into account multiple factors that relate both 
to prognosis and prediction. For example, testing for estrogen 
and progesterone receptor content as well as HER2 status is 
now considered standard of care. 3 Although these factors do 
have intrinsic prognostic value in regards to the risk of sub-
sequent recurrence for patients who do not receive systemic 
therapy, their main utility is to guide whether a patient should 
or should not receive adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) or 
anti-HER2 (such as trastuzumab) therapy. The use of these 
factors as predictive, rather than prognostic, markers is fun-
damentally important in evaluation and care of patients with 
newly diagnosed breast cancer, but the Committee found it 
difﬁ cult to devise a scheme in which they might be incorpo-
rated into the TNM system. 
 The situation has become even more complex with the 
availability of multigene expression assays. 4 One such assay, 
based on a 70-gene prognostic signature developed by inves-
tigators from Amsterdam, 5 has been cleared by the United 
States Food and Drug Administration for use in women who 
are less than 61 years old and who have stage I or II, node 
negative breast cancer, explicitly to “assess a patient’s risk for 
distant metastases.” (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/
cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=24303). The Tumor Marker 
Guidelines Committee of the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) has recommended that a second multigene 
assay, which is based on expression of 21-genes as determined 
by RT-PCR (designated the “21-gene recurrence score assay”) 
“can be used” to determine prognosis for patients with ER pos-
itive breast cancer and uninvolved lymph nodes who will, at 
the least, receive adjuvant tamoxifen, 2  and the Breast Commit-
tee of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
Guidelines states that “the use of genomic/gene expression 
arrays which also incorporate additional prognostic/predictive 
biomarkers (e.g., Oncotype Dx recurrence score) may provide 
additional prognostic and predictive information beyond ana-
tomic staging and determination of ER/PR and HER2 status.” 3 
How do such assays become incorporated into the TNM stag-
ing system, since they portend future outcomes in several ways? 
(1) As pure prognostic factors (the proﬁ le predicts the odds of 
recurrence independent of systemic therapy), 6 , 7 (2) as mark-
ers of residual risk assuming the patient will receive endocrine 
therapy (the proﬁ le predicts favorable or unfavorable chances 
of recurrence presumably due to both prognosis and predic-
tion of beneﬁ t or resistance to endocrine therapy), 5 , 8 , 9 and (3) 
perhaps as predictive factors for speciﬁ c types of, or all, chemo-
therapies. 10 , 11  
 Should these multiparameter prognostic assays that 
appear to predict outcomes in newly diagnosed breast can-
cer patients be included in staging? Since their value may be 
as much a predictor of response to chemotherapy regardless 
of TNM stage than as a prognostic factor, should an entirely 
new category related to prediction of beneﬁ t from systemic 
therapy be incorporated into the TNM staging system? In 
other words, increasingly in the modern era, many treatment 
decisions for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer are

not, or will not be, based on TNM stage. Although the size of 
the invasive cancer is a factor, the type of surgery for an indi-
vidual patient is usually determined by multicentricity and 
tumor margins, neither of which is part of TNM. Perhaps 
the only exception is the almost universal recommendation 
of mastectomy, regardless of other factors, for patients with 
inﬂ ammatory breast cancer. Large tumor size (T3 vs. T1, 2) 
and lymph node (N 1, 2, or 3 vs. N0) status do play a role in 
deciding whether radiation should be used after mastectomy 
or for directing the ﬁ elds of radiation for women undergoing 
breast preservation and in the recommendation for axillary 
dissection. However, in an era when many invasive cancers 
are detected at very small sizes when breast screening is used, 
multicentricity and tumor margins appear to be as important 
as T or N in determining optimal local treatment approaches. 
In the past, recommendations for most systemic therapy, espe-
cially chemotherapy, have been based on nodal status, and in 
the absence of involved lymph nodes, tumor size. 12 , 13 However, 
biologic features such as ER, progesterone receptor, HER2, and 
to some extent, grade, all play a role in a complex dance involv-
ing both prognosis and prediction for the speciﬁ c therapies. 
With ongoing advances in molecular biology and technology, 
coupled with increasing options for novel systemic therapies, 
such as agents that interfere with angiogenesis, we anticipate 
that anatomic staging with tumor size, lymph node status, and 
the presence of clinical and radiographically evident metastases 
may play increasingly less important roles than understanding 
of the biology of the cancer. 
 While the advances in molecular diagnosis have provided 
new insights into cancer therapy, the Committee understands 
that much of this consideration is relevant only to the societ-
ies in which resources permit widespread screening, molecu-
lar evaluation of tumor tissue, and application of cutting edge 
biological-directed therapies. Projecting to 2010, the annual 
global burden of new breast cancer cases will be 1.5 million 
and an ever-increasing fraction will be from low and middle 
income countries (LMCs). 14 Despite the common misconcep-
tion that breast cancer is predominantly a problem of wealthy 
countries, the majority of breast cancer deaths each year in 
fact occur in developing rather than developed countries. In 
this regard, LMCs may simply not be able to afford testing 
for individual molecular events or multiparameter proﬁ les, 
nor will they be able to provide expensive therapies directed 
against HER2 or other emerging targets. Tissue assays as basic 
as ER and PR may be unavailable in low income settings, even 
when oral endocrine therapies can be provided. Further com-
plicating these resource limitations, women in LMCs typi-
cally present with locally advanced (Stage III) or metastatic 
disease (Stage IV) at diagnosis. In these settings, downstaging 
of disease through early detection programs may be the most 
practical approach to improving cancer outcome at the popu-
lation level. 14 Thus, anatomic (TNM) staging remains a key 
aspect of cancer control in LMCs, because it directly reﬂ ects 
the degree to which early detection programs are working. 
While it is of value to continue education regarding the excit-
ing advances in molecular oncology in LMCs, anatomic 
staging will remain the fundamental cornerstone on which 
evaluation and treatment decisions of newly diagnosed breast 
cancer patients will be made. 
 Ultimately, and after much deliberation, the Task Force 
has elected to make minor to modest adjustments to the 
T, N, and M categories for the seventh edition to reﬂ ect new 
technologies and new clinical outcome data since the sixth 
edition. The Task Force has also substantially enhanced the 
“yp” category to distinguish stage after preoperative, or “neo-
adjuvant” systemic therapy and surgery. This designation has 
already been used by other disease groups, and its incorpora-
tion into the seventh edition seems appropriate in light of the 
growing application of this strategy. 15 
 Nonetheless, the Breast Cancer Task Force does not want 
to ignore the importance of tumor biology, both in predicting 
recurrence and beneﬁ ts from therapy. The Task Force did con-
sider adding a “B” category (for biology), in which the status of 
ER, PR, HER2, and even multigene expression proﬁ les would 
be incorporated and ultimately added to the Stage Grouping. 
However, for the reasons above, the Breast Cancer Task Force 
decided such a step would add little, since they are already used 
to care for individual patients. Such a change would, by deﬁ ni-
tion, completely abrogate at least the ﬁ rst objective of TNM 
staging elucidated above (linkage to the past), and it would 
almost certainly confuse the second (discussion among peers), 
since not all clinicians worldwide have access to the neces-
sary assays to determine them, especially the newer multigene 
assays. Therefore, although the Breast Cancer Task Force has 
not recommended changes to the TNM staging system to 
incorporate biology, we have requested that the invasive can-
cer data, if available, be collected in a highly detailed manner 
for inclusion into the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and 
other central registry databases. Although we recognize that 
the “prognostic” value of these data will be highly confounded 
by the effects of systemic therapy we hope this inclusion will 
permit future investigators to further deﬁ ne the role of these 
important features in future TNM deliberations.  
 ANATOMY 
 Primary Site.   The mammary gland, situated on the ante-
rior chest wall, is composed of glandular tissue with a dense 
ﬁ brous stroma. The glandular tissue consists of lobules that 
group together into 8–15 lobes, occasionally more, arranged 
approximately in a spoke-like pattern. Multiple major and 
minor ducts connect the milk-secreting lobular units to the 
nipple. Small milk ducts course throughout the breast, con-
verging into larger collecting ducts that open into the lactif-
erous sinus at the base of the nipple. Each duct system has 
unique anatomy: the smallest systems may comprise only a 
portion of a quadrant whereas the largest systems may com-
prise more than a quadrant. The periphery of each system 
overlaps along their radial boundaries. Most cancers form 
initially in the terminal duct lobular units of the breast. Car-
cinoma spreads along the duct system in the radial axis of 
the lobe; invasive carcinoma is more likely to spread in a cen-
tripetal orientation in the breast stroma from the initial locus

of invasion, although opportunistic intraductal spread may 
be enhanced along the radial axes. Glandular tissue is more 
abundant in the upper outer portion of the breast; as a result, 
half of all breast cancers occur in this area. 
 Chest Wall.   The chest wall includes ribs, intercostal muscles, 
and serratus anterior muscle, but not the pectoral muscles. 
Therefore, involvement of the pectoral muscle does not con-
stitute chest wall invasion. 
 Regional Lymph Nodes.   The breast lymphatics drain by 
way of three major routes: axillary, transpectoral, and inter-
nal mammary. Intramammary lymph nodes reside within 
breast tissue and are coded as axillary lymph nodes for stag-
ing purposes. Supraclavicular lymph nodes are classiﬁ ed as 
regional lymph nodes for staging purposes. Metastases to any 
other lymph node, including cervical or contralateral internal 
mammary or axillary lymph nodes, are classiﬁ ed as distant 
(M1) (Figure  32.1 .) 
 The regional lymph nodes are as follows:
  1.  Axillary (ipsilateral): interpectoral (Rotter’s) nodes and 
lymph nodes along the axillary vein and its tributaries 
that may be (but are not required to be) divided into 
the following levels:
 a.  Level I (low-axilla): lymph nodes lateral to the lat-
eral border of pectoralis minor muscle. 
 b.  Level II (mid-axilla): lymph nodes between the 
medial and lateral borders of the pectoralis minor 
muscle and the interpectoral (Rotter’s) lymph nodes. 
 c.  Level III (apical axilla): lymph nodes medial to the 
medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle and 
inferior to the clavicle. These are also known as 
apical or infraclavicular nodes. Metastases to these 
nodes portend a worse prognosis. Therefore, the 
infraclavicular designation will be used hereafter to 
differentiate these nodes from the remaining (level 
I, II) axillary nodes. 
   2.   Internal mammary (ipsilateral): lymph nodes in the 
intercostal spaces along the edge of the sternum in the 
endothoracic fascia.  
  3.  Supraclavicular: lymph nodes in the supraclavicular 
fossa, a triangle deﬁ ned by the omohyoid muscle and 
tendon (lateral and superior border), the internal jugu-
lar vein (medial border), and the clavicle and subclavian 
vein (lower border). Adjacent lymph nodes outside of 
this triangle are considered to be lower cervical nodes 
(M1). 
   4.   Intramammary: lymph nodes within the breast; these 
are considered axillary lymph nodes for purposes of N 
classiﬁ cation and staging. 
 Metastatic Sites.   Tumor cells may be disseminated by either 
the lymphatic or the blood vascular system. The four major 
sites of involvement are bone, lung, brain, and liver, but tumor 
cells are also capable of metastasizing to many other sites. 
Bone marrow micrometastases, circulating tumor cells, and 
tumor deposits no larger than 0.2 mm detected inadvertently, 
such as in prophylactically removed ovarian tissue, are collec-
tively known as microscopic disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). 
These deposits do not alone deﬁ ne or constitute metastatic 
disease, although there are data that demonstrate that, in early 
stage disease, DTCs correlate with recurrence and mortality 
risk, and in patients with established M1 disease, circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs) are prognostic for shorter survival.  
 RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION 
 Clinical Staging.   Clinical staging includes physical exam-
ination, with careful inspection and palpation of the skin, 
mammary gland, and lymph nodes (axillary, supraclavicu-
lar, and cervical), imaging, and pathologic examination of 
the breast or other tissues as appropriate to establish the 
diagnosis of breast carcinoma. The extent of tissue exam-
ined pathologically for clinical staging is not as great as that 
required for pathologic staging (see “Pathologic Staging” 
below). Imaging ﬁ ndings are considered elements of stag-
ing if they are collected within 4 months of diagnosis in the 
absence of disease progression or through completion of 
surgery, whichever is longer. Such imaging ﬁ ndings would 
include the size of the primary invasive cancer and of chest 
wall invasion, and the presence or absence of regional or dis-
tant metastases. Imaging and clinical ﬁ ndings obtained after 
a patient has been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy 
are not considered elements of initial clinical staging. If 
recorded in the medical record, these should be denoted 
using the modiﬁ er preﬁ x “yc.”

 Pathologic Staging.    Pathologic staging includes all data 
used for clinical staging, plus data from surgical explora-
tion and resection as well as pathologic examination (gross 
and microscopic) of the primary carcinoma, regional lymph 
nodes, and metastatic sites (if applicable), including not less 
than excision of the primary carcinoma with no macroscopic 
tumor in any margin of resection by pathologic examination. 
A cancer can be classiﬁ ed pT for pathologic stage grouping if 
there is only microscopic, but not macroscopic, involvement 
at the margin. If there is transected tumor in the margin of 
resection by macroscopic examination, the pathologic size 
of the tumor may be estimated from available information 
but will not necessarily be the sum of the sizes of multiple 
resected pieces of tumor. 
 If the primary tumor is invasive (with a possible exception 
of microinvasive cancer), resection of at least the low axillary 
lymph nodes (Level I) – that is, those lymph nodes located lat-
eral to the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle – should 
be performed for pathologic (pN) classiﬁ cation. Such a resec-
tion will ordinarily include six or more lymph nodes. Alter-
natively, one or more sentinel lymph nodes may be resected 
and examined for pathologic classiﬁ cation [pN(sn)]. Certain 
histologic invasive cancer types [classic tubular carcinoma 
<1 cm, classic mucinous carcinoma <1 cm, and microinva-
sive carcinoma (pT1mi)] have a very low incidence of axillary 
lymph node metastases and may not require an axillary lymph 
node dissection, although sentinel lymph node biopsy may be 
appropriate. Cancerous nodules in the axillary fat adjacent to 
the breast, without histologic evidence of residual lymph node 
tissue, are classiﬁ ed as regional lymph node metastases ( ≥ N1). 
Pathologic stage grouping includes the following two combi-
nations of pathologic and clinical classiﬁ cations: pT pN pM, 
or pT pN cM. If surgery occurs after the patient has received 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunother-
apy, or radiation therapy, the preﬁ x “yp” should be used with 
the TNM classiﬁ cation, for example, ypTNM.  
 Primary Tumor (T) 
 Determining Tumor Size.  The original size of a primary 
tumor (T) can be measured based on clinical ﬁ ndings (physi-
cal examination and imaging modalities such as mammog-
raphy, ultrasound, and MRI) and pathologic ﬁ ndings (gross 
and microscopic measurements). Clinical tumor size (cT) 
should be based on the clinical ﬁ ndings that are judged to be 
most accurate for a particular case, although it may still be 
somewhat inaccurate because the extent of some breast can-
cers is not always apparent with current imaging techniques, 
and because tumors are composed of varying proportions of 
noninvasive and invasive disease, which these techniques are 
currently unable to distinguish. Pathologic tumor size (pT) 
based on gross measurement may also be somewhat inaccu-
rate for the same reasons, although microscopic assessment is 
able to distinguish noninvasive and invasive carcinoma, and 
microscopically determined pT should be based on measur-
ing  only the invasive component . For small invasive tumors 
that can be submitted in one section/parafﬁ n block, the 
microscopic measurement is the most accurate way to deter-
mine pT. If an invasive tumor is too large to be submitted 
for microscopic evaluation in one tissue section/block, the 
gross measurement is the preferred method of determining 
pT. Whichever method is used, pT should be recorded to the 
nearest millimeter. The size of the primary tumor is measured 
for T classiﬁ cation before any tissue is removed for special 
purposes, such as prognostic biomarkers or tumor banking. 
In patients who have undergone diagnostic core biopsies 
prior to surgical excision (particularly vacuum-assisted core 
biopsy sampling), measuring only the residual tumor may 
result in underclassifying the T component and understaging 
the tumor, especially with smaller tumors. In such cases, the 
original invasive cancer size should be estimated and veriﬁ ed 
based on the best combination of imaging, gross, and micro-
scopic histological ﬁ ndings. Adding the maximum invasive 
cancer dimension on the core biopsy to the residual inva-
sive tumor in the excision is not recommended as this often 
overestimates maximum tumor dimension. In general, the 
maximum dimension in either the core biopsy or the excisional 
biopsy is used for T classiﬁ cation unless imaging dimensions 
suggest a larger invasive cancer. 
 For patients who receive neoadjuvant systemic or radia-
tion therapy, it is not possible to determine a pretreatment 
pathologic size. Therefore, pretreatment T is deﬁ ned as clini-
cal (cT). Pretreatment staging is clinical, and the clinical mea-
surement deﬁ ned from examination and imaging is recorded 
(cT). Posttreatment (ypT) size should be estimated based on 
the best combination of imaging, gross, and microscopic his-
tological ﬁ ndings. The size of some invasive cancers, regard-
less of previous biopsy or chemotherapy, may be unapparent 
to any imaging modalities or gross pathologic examination. 
In these cases, invasive cancer size can be estimated by care-
fully measuring and recording the relative positions of tissue 
samples submitted for microscopic evaluation and determin-
ing which contain invasive cancer. 
 Tis Classiﬁ cation.   Pure noninvasive carcinoma, or carcinoma 
in situ, is classiﬁ ed as Tis, with an additional parenthetical 
subclassiﬁ cation indicating the subtype. Three subtypes are 
currently recognized, including ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and Paget’s dis-
ease of the nipple with no underlying invasive cancer. These 
are categorized as Tis (DCIS), Tis (LCIS), and Tis (Paget’s), 
respectively. “Intraductal carcinoma” is an outmoded term 
for DCIS, which is still used occasionally, and tumors referred 
to in this manner (which is discouraged) should be catego-
rized as Tis (DCIS). “Ductal intraepithelial neoplasia” (DIN) 
is a recently proposed but uncommonly used terminology 
encompassing both DCIS and atypical ductal hyperplasia 
(ADH), and only cases referred to as DIN containing DCIS 
(±ADH) should be classiﬁ ed as Tis (DCIS). 16 , 17 Similarly, 
“lobular intraepithelial neoplasia” (LIN) is an uncommon 
terminology encompassing both atypical lobular hyperplasia 
(ALH) and LCIS, and only cases referred to as LIN containing 
LCIS (±ALH) should be classiﬁ ed as Tis (LCIS). 18 DIN and 
LIN are not widely accepted terminology. “Lobular neoplasia

in situ” is an outmoded term also encompassing both ALH 
and LCIS, and only tumors referred to in this manner (which 
is discouraged) containing LCIS (±ALH) should be classiﬁ ed 
as Tis (LCIS). If DCIS and LCIS are both present, the tumor 
is currently classiﬁ ed as Tis (DCIS). A recently published 
Cancer Protocol and Checklist from the College of American 
Pathology provides much greater detail regarding deﬁ nition 
and evaluation of in situ cancer of the breast 19 (http://www.
cap.org). 
 Paget’s disease is characterized clinically by an exudate or 
crust of the nipple and areola caused by inﬁ ltration of the epi-
dermis by noninvasive breast cancer epithelial cells. This con-
dition usually occurs in one of the following three settings 20 : 
(1) Associated with an invasive carcinoma in the underlying 
breast parenchyma. The T classiﬁ cation should be based on 
the size of the invasive disease. (2) Associated with an under-
lying noninvasive carcinoma, usually DCIS but rarely LCIS. T 
classiﬁ cation should be based on the underlying tumor as Tis 
(DCIS) or Tis (LCIS), accordingly. However, the presence of 
Paget’s disease associated with invasive or noninvasive carci-
nomas should still be recorded. (3) Not associated with iden-
tiﬁ able underlying invasive or noninvasive disease. These are 
the only lesions that should be classiﬁ ed as Tis (Paget’s). 
 The size of noninvasive carcinomas does not change their 
T classiﬁ cation. However, because tumor size may inﬂ uence 
therapeutic decisions, an estimate of size should be still pro-
vided based on the best combination of imaging, gross, and 
microscopic histological ﬁ ndings. 19 Sizing of LCIS may be dif-
ﬁ cult, but an attempt to do so, based on either clinical/radio-
graphic and/or pathologic features, is recommended.  
 Microinvasive Carcinoma.  Microinvasive carcinoma is 
deﬁ ned as an invasive carcinoma with no focus measuring 
>1 mm. In cases with only one focus, its microscopic mea-
surement should be provided. In cases with multiple foci, the 
pathologist should attempt to quantify the number of foci 
and the range of their sizes, including the largest, but should 
not report the size of the tumor as the sum of the sizes. If 
there are multiple foci, reporting of the number may be difﬁ -
cult. In these cases, it is recommended that an estimate of the 
number be provided, or alternatively a note that the number 
of foci of microinvasion is too numerous to quantify, but that 
no identiﬁ ed focus is larger than 1.0 mm. Microinvasive car-
cinoma is nearly always encountered in a setting of DCIS (or, 
less often, LCIS) where small foci of tumor cells have invaded 
through the basement membrane into the surrounding 
stroma, although rare cases are encountered in the absence 
of noninvasive disease. The prognosis of microinvasive carci-
noma is generally thought to be quite favorable, although the 
clinical impact of multifocal microinvasive disease is not well 
understood at this time. 
 Multiple Simultaneous Ipsilateral Primary Carcinomas. 
 Multiple simultaneous ipsilateral primary carcinomas are 
deﬁ ned as inﬁ ltrating carcinomas in the same breast, which 
are grossly or macroscopically distinct and measurable using 
available clinical and pathologic techniques. T stage assign-
ment in this setting should be based only on the largest 
tumor, and the sum of the sizes should not be used. How-
ever, the presence and sizes of the smaller tumor(s) should 
be recorded using the “(m)” modiﬁ er as deﬁ ned by the TNM 
rules in Chap. 1. 
 Invasive cancers that are in close proximity, but are appar-
ently separate grossly, may represent truly separate tumors 
or one tumor with a complex shape. Distinguishing these 
two situations may require judgment and close correlation 
between pathologic and clinical ﬁ ndings (especially imaging), 
and preference should be given to the modality thought to be 
the most accurate in a speciﬁ c case. When macroscopically 
apparently distinct tumors are very close (e.g., <5 mm), espe-
cially if they are similar histologically, they are most likely one 
tumor with a complex shape, and their T category should be 
based on the largest combined dimension. Careful and com-
prehensive microscopic evaluation often reveals subtle areas 
of continuity between tumor foci in this setting. However, 
contiguous uniform tumor density in the intervening tissue 
is needed to justify adding two grossly distinct masses. These 
criteria apply to multiple macroscopically measurable tumors 
and do not apply to one macroscopic carcinoma associated 
with multiple separate microscopic (satellite) foci. Tumors 
along the same approximate radial axis are frequently related 
and have arisen in the same duct system.  
 Simultaneous Bilateral Primary Carcinomas.  Each carci-
noma is staged as a separate primary carcinoma in a separate 
organ based on its own characteristics, including T category 
as speciﬁ ed in the TNM rules (see Chap. 1). 
 Inﬂ ammatory Carcinoma.  Inﬂ ammatory carcinoma is a 
clinical-pathologic entity characterized by diffuse erythema 
and edema (peau d’orange) involving a third or more of the 
skin of the breast. 21  The tumor of inﬂ ammatory carcinoma is 
classiﬁ ed T4d. It is important to remember that inﬂ amma-
tory carcinoma is primarily a clinical diagnosis. On imaging, 
there may be a detectable mass and characteristic thickening 
of the skin over the breast. An underlying mass may or may 
not be palpable, although imaging modalities often reveal 
one. The skin changes are due to lymphedema caused by 
tumor emboli within dermal lymphatics, which may or may 
not be obvious in a small skin biopsy. However, a tissue diag-
nosis is still necessary to demonstrate an invasive carcinoma 
in the underlying breast parenchyma or at least in the dermal 
lymphatics, as well as to determine biologic markers, such as 
estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status. 
Tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics without the clinical skin 
changes described above do not qualify as inﬂ ammatory car-
cinoma. Locally advanced breast cancers directly invading the 
dermis or ulcerating the skin without the clinical skin changes 
and tumor emboli in dermal lymphatics also do not qualify as 
inﬂ ammatory carcinoma. Thus, the term  inﬂ ammatory carci-
noma  should not be applied to a patient with neglected locally 
advanced cancer of the breast presenting late in the course 
of her disease. The rare case that exhibits all the features of 
inﬂ ammatory breast carcinoma, but in which skin changes

 Skin of Breast.  Dimpling of the skin, nipple retraction, or 
any other skin change except those described under T4b and 
T4d may occur in T1, T2, or T3 without changing the clas-
siﬁ cation.   
 Regional Lymph Nodes (N) 
 Macrometastases.  Cases in which regional lymph nodes 
cannot be assessed (previously removed or not removed for 
pathologic examination) are designated NX or pNX. Cases 
in which no regional lymph node metastases are detected are 
designated cN0 or pN0. 
 For patients who are clinically node-positive, cN1 desig-
nates metastases to one or more movable ipsilateral level I, II 
axillary lymph nodes, cN2a designates metastases to level I, II 
axillary lymph nodes that are ﬁ xed to each other (matted) or 
to other structures, and cN3a indicates metastases to ipsilat-
eral infraclavicular (level III axillary) lymph nodes. Metasta-
ses to the ipsilateral internal mammary nodes are designated 
as cN2b when they are detected by imaging studies (including 
CT scan and ultrasound, but excluding lymphoscintigraphy) 
or by clinical examination and when they do not occur in 
conjunction with metastases to the level I, II axillary lymph 
nodes. Metastases to the ipsilateral internal mammary nodes 
are designated as cN3b when they are detected by imaging 
studies or by clinical examination and when they occur in 
conjunction with metastases to the level I, II axillary lymph 
nodes. Metastases to the ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph 
nodes are designated as cN3c regardless of the presence or 
absence of axillary or internal mammary nodal involvement. 
Since lymph nodes that are detected by clinical or imaging 
examination are frequently larger than 1.0 cm, the presence 
of tumor deposits should be conﬁ rmed by ﬁ ne needle aspi-
rate or core biopsy with cytologic/histologic examination if 
possible. Lymph nodes classiﬁ ed as malignant by clinical or 
imaging characteristics alone, or only by ﬁ ne needle aspirate 
cytology examination or core biopsy, and not by formal surgi-
cal dissection and pathologic review, are presumed to contain 
macrometastases for purposes of clinical staging classiﬁ ca-
tion. When conﬁ rmed by ﬁ ne needle aspirate or core biopsy, 
the (f) modiﬁ er should be used to indicate cytologic/histo-
logic conﬁ rmation, for example, cN2a(f). Pathologic classiﬁ -
cation rules apply when lymph nodes are removed by surgical 
excisional biopsy and examined histopathologically. 
 For patients who are pathologically node-positive with 
macrometastases, at least one node must contain a tumor 
deposit greater than 2 mm and all remaining quantiﬁ ed 
nodes must contain tumor deposits greater than 0.2 mm (at 
least micrometastases); nodes containing only tumor depos-
its  ≤ 0.2 mm (ITCs) are excluded from the positive node count 
for purposes of N classiﬁ cation but should be recorded as 
additional ITC involved nodes and should be included in the 
total nodes evaluated. Cases with 1–3 positive level I/II axil-
lary lymph nodes are classiﬁ ed pN1a; cases with 4–9 positive 
axillary lymph nodes are classiﬁ ed pN2a, and cases with 10 
or more positive axillary lymph nodes are classiﬁ ed pN3a. 
Cases with histologically conﬁ rmed metastases to the internal 
mammary nodes, detected by sentinel lymph node dissection 
but not by clinical examination or imaging studies (excluding 
lymphoscintigraphy), are classiﬁ ed as pN1b if occurring in 
the  absence of metastases to the axillary lymph nodes and as 
pN1c if occurring in the  presence  of metastases to 1–3 axil-
lary lymph nodes. If four or more axillary lymph nodes are 
involved, and internal mammary sentinel nodes are involved, 
the classiﬁ cation pN3b is used. Pathologic classiﬁ cation is 
used when axillary nodes have been histologically examined 
and clinical involvement of the ipsilateral internal mammary 
nodes is detected by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscin-
tigraphy); in the absence or presence of axillary nodal metas-
tases, pN2b and pN3b classiﬁ cation is used, respectively. 
 Histologic evidence of metastases in ipsilateral supra-
clavicular lymph node(s) is classiﬁ ed as pN3c. A classiﬁ cation 
of pN3, regardless of primary tumor size or grade, is classiﬁ ed 
as Stage IIIC. A case in which the classiﬁ cation is based only 
on sentinel lymph node biopsy is given the additional desig-
nation (sn) for “sentinel node” – for example, pN1(sn). For 
a case in which an initial classiﬁ cation is based on a sentinel 
lymph node biopsy but a standard axillary lymph node dis-
section is subsequently performed, the classiﬁ cation is based 
on the total results of both the axillary lymph node dissec-
tion and the sentinel node biopsy, and the (sn) modiﬁ er is 
removed. The (sn) modiﬁ er indicates that nodal classiﬁ cation 
is based on less than an axillary dissection. When the com-
bination of sentinel and nonsentinel nodes removed is less 
than a standard low axillary dissection (less than six nodes) 
the (sn) modiﬁ er is used. The number of quantiﬁ ed nodes 
for staging is generally the number of grossly identiﬁ ed, his-
tologically conﬁ rmed lymph nodes. Care should be taken to 
avoid overcounting sectioned nodes or sectioned adipose tis-
sue with no grossly apparent nodes. 
 The ﬁ rst priority in pathologic evaluation of lymph nodes 
is to identify all macrometastases (metastases larger than 
2.0 mm). The entire lymph node should be submitted for 
evaluation and larger nodes should be bisected or thinly sliced 
no thicker than 2.0 mm. A single histologic section of each 
slice has a high probability of detecting all macrometastases 
present although the largest dimension of the metastases may 
not be represented. More comprehensive evaluation of lymph 
node parafﬁ n blocks is not required for staging; however, 
techniques such as multilevel sectioning and immunohis-
tochemistry will identify additional tumor deposits, typically 
less than or equal to 2.0 mm [micrometastases and isolated 
tumor cell clusters (ITCs)]. It is not recommended that nodal 
tissue that may contain a macrometastasis be diverted for 
experimental or alternative testing, such as molecular analy-
sis, if this diversion would potentially result in the pathologist 
missing macrometastases detectable by routine microscopic 
examination.

in largest dimension, or single cells, usually with little if any 
histologic stromal reaction. ITCs may be detected by routine 
histology or by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. When 
no single metastasis larger than 0.2 mm is identiﬁ ed, regard-
less of the number of nodes containing ITCs, the regional 
lymph nodes should be designated as pN0(i+) or pN0(i+)
(sn), as appropriate, and the number of ITC-involved nodes 
should be noted. 
 Approximately 1,000 tumor cells are contained in a three-
dimensional 0.2-mm cluster. Thus, if more than 200 individ-
ual tumor cells are identiﬁ ed as single dispersed tumor cells 
or as a nearly conﬂ uent elliptical or spherical focus in a single 
histologic section of a lymph node there is a high probability 
that more than 1,000 cells are present in the lymph node. In 
these situations, the node should be classiﬁ ed as containing 
a micrometastasis (pN1mi). Cells in different lymph node 
cross or longitudinal sections or levels of the block are not 
added together; the 200 cells must be in a single node proﬁ le 
even if the node has been thinly sectioned into multiple slices. 
It is recognized that there is substantial overlap between the 
upper limit of the ITC and the lower limit of the microme-
tastasis categories due to inherent limitations in pathologic 
nodal evaluation and detection of minimal tumor burden 
in lymph nodes. Thus, the threshold of 200 cells in a single 
cross-section is a guideline to help pathologists distinguish 
between these two categories. The pathologist should use 
judgment regarding whether it is likely that the cluster of cells 
represents a true micrometastasis or is simply a small group 
of isolated tumor cells. 
 Micrometastases are deﬁ ned as tumor deposits greater 
than 0.2 mm but not greater than 2.0 mm in largest dimen-
sion. Cases in which at least one micrometastasis is detected 
but no metastases greater than 2 mm (macrometastases) are 
detected, regardless of the number of involved nodes, are clas-
siﬁ ed pN1mi or pN1mi(sn), as appropriate, and the number 
of involved nodes should be noted. 
 The size of a tumor deposit is determined by measuring 
the largest dimension of any group of cells that are touching 
one another (conﬂ uent or contiguous tumor cells) regardless 
of whether the deposit is conﬁ ned to the lymph node, extends 
outside the node (extranodal or extracapsular extension), or is 
totally present outside the lymph node and invading adipose. 
When there are multiple tumor deposits in a lymph node, 
whether ITCs or micrometastases, the size of only the largest 
contiguous tumor deposit is used to classify the node; do not 
use the sum of all individual tumor deposits. When a tumor 
deposit has induced a ﬁ brous (desmoplastic) stromal reac-
tion, the combined contiguous dimension of tumor cells and 
ﬁ brosis determines size of the metastasis. When a single case 
contains multiple positive lymph nodes and the largest tumor 
deposit in each node is categorically distinct, the number of 
nodes in each category (macrometastases, micrometastases, 
ITCs) may be recorded separately to facilitate N classiﬁ cation 
as described previously. 
 If histologically negative lymph nodes are examined for 
evidence of unique tumor or epithelial cell markers using 
molecular 
methods 
[reverse 
transcriptase–polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR)] and these markers are detected, 
the regional lymph nodes are classiﬁ ed as pN0(mol+) or 
pN0(mol+)(sn), as appropriate. Sacriﬁ cing lymph node tissue 
for molecular analysis that would otherwise be available for 
histologic evaluation and staging is not recommended par-
ticularly when the size of the sacriﬁ ced tissue is large enough 
to contain a macrometastasis. If these data are generated, they 
should be collected by the registrar. 
 Distant Metastases (M).   Cases in which there are no dis-
tant metastases as determined by clinical and/or radiographic 
methods are designated cM0, and cases in which one or more 
distant metastases are identiﬁ ed by clinical and/or radio-
graphic methods are designated cM1. Positive supraclavicular 
lymph nodes are classiﬁ ed as N3 (see previous discussion). A 
case is classiﬁ ed as clinically free of metastases (cM0) unless 
there is documented evidence of metastases by clinical means 
(cM1) or by biopsy of a metastatic site (pM1). M stage of 
breast cancer refers to the classiﬁ cation of clinically signiﬁ -
cant distant metastases, which typically distinguishes whether 
or not there is a potential for long-term cure. The ascertain-
ment of M stage requires evaluations consisting of a review of 
systems, physical examination and often also includes radio-
graphic imaging, blood work, and tissue biopsy. The types of 
examinations needed in each case may vary and guidelines for 
these are available. 22  M classiﬁ cation is based on best clinical 
and radiographic interpretation, but pathologic conﬁ rmation 
is recommended, although it may not be obtained for rea-
sons of feasibility or safety. Additionally, M stage assessment 
may not yield a deﬁ nitive answer on the initial set of evalua-
tions, and follow-up studies may be needed such that the ﬁ nal 
determination is a recursive and iterative process, assuming 
that the area of question was present at the time of diagnosis 
of the primary breast cancer. In these cases, the designated 
stage should remain M0 unless a deﬁ nitive designation is 
made that the patient truly had detectable metastases at the 
time of diagnosis, based on the guidelines that follow. Subse-
quent development of new metastases in areas not previously 
thought to be suspicious does not change the patient’s origi-
nal stage and the patient would now be considered to have 
converted to recurrent Stage IV, which is considered recurrent 
disease without altering the original stage. 
 Physical Examination.  Detection of metastatic disease by 
clinical exam should include a full physical examination with 
focused detail based on symptoms and radiographic ﬁ ndings. 
When appropriate, serial physical examinations based on evolv-
ing symptoms, physical ﬁ ndings, radiographic ﬁ ndings, and/or 
laboratory ﬁ ndings should be done on an iterative basis. Physi-
cal ﬁ ndings alone rarely will provide the basis for assigning 
M1 stage, and radiographic studies are almost always required. 
Whenever feasible, biopsy conﬁ rmation should be performed. 
 Radiographic Studies.   It is not necessary for the patient to 
have radiological evaluation of distant sites to be classiﬁ ed as 
clinically free of metastases. The indication for the indicated 
radiographic evaluation for the presence of an M lesion in the

staging of breast cancer is uncertain and varies by T and N 
stage category. Certainly, all guidelines stipulate that suspicious 
ﬁ ndings in the history or physical examination, and/or ele-
vated serologic tests for liver or bone function, are indications 
to proceed with radiographic systemic imaging, such as bone 
or body scintigraphy or anatomic, cross-sectional imaging. 
Most experts agree that systemic radiographic staging evalua-
tion for metastases is not warranted in asymptomatic patients 
with normal blood tests who have T1-2, N0 breast cancer, and 
likewise most experts agree that staging is appropriate for 
patients with Stage III disease (clinical or pathologic). Rec-
ommendations are mixed for patients with T2N1. 
 Regardless, staging studies should focus on common sites 
of metastatic disease and/or sites indicated by symptoms or 
blood tests. Certain ﬁ ndings such as multiple lesions with 
classical characteristics of metastases, and clear changes from 
earlier studies may provide a very high index of suspicion 
and result in M1 classiﬁ cation. With radiographic screening 
or evaluation for another cause, false positive staging stud-
ies in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer are rela-
tively common. Pathologic conﬁ rmation of metastatic disease 
should be performed whenever feasible. 
 Tissue Biopsy.   The type of biopsy of a suspicious lesion 
should be guided by the location of the suspected metastases 
along with patient preference, safety, and the expertise and 
equipment available to the care team. Fine needle aspiration 
(FNA) is adequate, especially for visceral lesions and with 
the availability of experienced cytopathologic interpretation. 
Negative FNA or cellular atypia might carry a signiﬁ cant risk 
of false negativity, especially in bony or scirrhous lesions, so 
consideration of repeat FNA or other biopsy techniques such 
as core needle or open surgical biopsy may be warranted. 
Histopathologic examination should include standard H&E 
staining and in some cases may require additional immuno-
histochemical staining or other specialized testing for con-
ﬁ rmation of breast cancer or other cancer type. If adequate 
biomarker data (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, 
HER2) are not available from the primary tumor, these should 
be obtained on any other biopsy that shows cancer on H&E 
staining. Special caution should be taken with evaluation of 
tumor markers in tissue collected from bone biopsies. Decal-
ciﬁ cation procedures may create false negative results for both 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ﬂ uorescent in situ hybrid-
ization (FISH). Incidentally detected cancer cells, clusters of 
cancer cells or foci  ≤ 0.2 mm, or circulating tumor cells that 
are otherwise clinically and radiographically silent should not 
alone constitute M1 disease and are discussed below. 
 Laboratory Abnormalities.   Patients with abnormal liver func-
tion tests should undergo liver imaging, whereas those with 
elevated alkaline phosphatase or calcium levels, or suggestive 
symptoms, should undergo bone imaging and/or scintigra-
phy. Unexplained anemia and other cytopenias require a full 
hematologic evaluation (e.g., examination of the peripheral 
smear, iron studies, B12/folate levels) and should be investi-
gated with bone imaging and a bone marrow biopsy depend-
ing on the results of the evaluation. Other unexplained 
laboratory abnormalities such as elevations in renal function 
should also prompt appropriate imaging tests. Elevated tumor 
markers are known to be associated with variable degrees of 
false positivity and their use has not been shown to improve 
outcome. The routine ordering of these tests, such as CA 15-3, 
CA 27.29, CEA, and other protein-based markers for staging 
is not indicated. 2 
 Circulating Tumor Cells, Bone Marrow Micrometastases, and 
Disseminated Tumor Cells.  The presence of circulating tumor 
cells (CTCs) in the blood or micrometastases ( ≤ 0.2 mm) in the 
bone marrow or other nonregional nodal tissues should not be 
used to deﬁ ne M stage in the absence of other apparent clini-
cal and/or radiographic ﬁ ndings that correspond to pathologic 
ﬁ ndings. However, an increasing number of studies are show-
ing microscopic bone marrow and circulating tumor cells in 
M0 disease to be prognostic for recurrence or survival. Thus, 
denotation of histologically visible micrometastases in bone 
marrow, blood, or other organs distant from the breast and 
regional lymph nodes should be denoted by the term M0(i+). 
For M1 stage breast cancer (clinically and/or radiographically 
detectable metastases), the enumeration of CTCs at the time of 
diagnosis of metastatic disease has been shown to strongly cor-
relate with survival, but neither the presence nor the number of 
CTCs will change the overall classiﬁ cation.    
 OUTCOMES 
 Figure  32.2 shows percent survival at 5 years by size of primary 
tumor and number of nodes involved. Figure  32.3 shows 
observed survival rates for 211,645 cases with carcinoma of 
the breast diagnosed in years 2001–2002.

 DEFINITIONS OF TNM 
 The increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy in breast can-
cer and the documented prognostic impact of postneoad-
juvant extent of disease and response to therapy warrant 
clear definitions of the use of the “yp” prefix and response 
to therapy. The use of neoadjuvant therapy does not change 
the clinical (pretreatment) stage. As per TNM rules, the 
clinical stage is identified with the prefix “c”. In addition, 
the use of fine needle aspiration and sentinel lymph node 
biopsy before neoadjuvant therapy is denoted with the sub-
scripts “f” and “sn,” respectively. Nodal metastases detected 
by FNA or core biopsy are classified as macrometastases 
(N1) regardless of the size of the tumor focus in the final 
pathologic specimen. For example, if, prior to neoadjuvant 
systemic therapy, a patient has no palpable nodes but has 
an ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of an axillary lymph 
node that is positive, the patient will be categorized as cN1 
(f) for her clinical (pretreatment) staging and would be 
considered as stage IIA. Likewise, if the patient has a posi-
tive axillary sentinel node identified prior to neoadjuvant 
systemic therapy, the patient will be categorized as cN1 
(sn) (Stage IIA). 
 As per TNM rules, with the absence of pathologic T eval-
uation (removal of the primary tumor), microscopic evalua-
tion of nodes before neoadjuvant therapy is still classiﬁ ed as 
clinical “c.” 
 Primary Tumor (T) 
The T classiﬁ cation of the primary tumor is the same 
regardless of whether it is based on clinical or pathologic 
criteria, or both. Size should be measured to the nearest 
millimeter. If the tumor size is slightly less than or greater 
than a cutoff for a given T classiﬁ cation, it is recom-
mended that the size be rounded to the millimeter read-
ing that is closest to the cutoff. For example, a reported 
size of 1.1 mm is reported as 1 mm, or a size of 2.01 cm 
is reported as 2.0 cm. Designation should be made with 
the subscript “c” or “p” modiﬁ er to indicate whether 
the T classiﬁ cation was determined by clinical (physical 
examination or radiologic) or pathologic measurements, 
respectively. In general, pathologic determination should 
take precedence over clinical determination of T size.

 Posttreatment ypT.  Clinical (pretreatment) T will be deﬁ ned by 
clinical and radiographic ﬁ ndings, while y pathologic (posttreat-
ment) T will be determined by pathologic size and extension. 
The ypT will be measured as the largest single focus of invasive 
tumor, with the modiﬁ er “m” indicating multiple foci. The mea-
surement of the largest tumor focus should not include areas of 
ﬁ brosis within the tumor bed. The inclusion of additional infor-
mation in the pathology report such as the distance over which 
tumor foci extend, the number of tumor foci present, or the 
number of slides/blocks in which tumor appears may assist 
the clinician in estimating the extent of disease. A comparison 
of the cellularity in the initial biopsy to that in the posttreatment 
specimen may also aid in the assessment of response. 
 Note : If a cancer was designated as inﬂ ammatory before neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient will be designated to have 
inﬂ ammatory breast cancer throughout, even if the patient 
has complete resolution of inﬂ ammatory ﬁ ndings.

 Notes: 
 * Classiﬁ cation is based on axillary lymph node dissection 
with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy. Classiﬁ cation 
based solely on sentinel lymph node biopsy without subse-
quent axillary lymph node dissection is designated (sn) for 
“sentinel node,” for example, pN0(sn). 
 ** RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction. 
  *** “Not clinically detected” is deﬁ ned as not detected by imag-
ing studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) or not detected 
by clinical examination. 
 **** “Clinically detected” is deﬁ ned as detected by imaging 
studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) or by clinical exami-
nation and having characteristics highly suspicious for malig-
nancy or a presumed pathologic macrometastasis based on 
ﬁ ne needle aspiration biopsy with cytologic examination. 
 Posttreatment ypN 
 
● Post-treatment yp “N” should be evaluated as for clini-
cal (pretreatment) “N” methods above. The modiﬁ er 
“sn” is used only if a sentinel node evaluation was per-
formed after treatment. If no subscript is attached, it is 
assumed that the axillary nodal evaluation was by axil-
lary node dissection (AND). 
 
● The X classiﬁ cation will be used (ypNX) if no yp post-
treatment SN or AND was performed 
 
● N categories are the same as those used for pN. 
Distant Metastases (M)
M0
No clinical or radiographic evidence of dis-
tant metastases
cM0(i+)
No clinical or radiographic evidence of dis-
tant metastases, but deposits of molecularly 
or microscopically detected tumor cells in 
circulating blood, bone marrow, or other 
nonregional nodal tissue that are no larger 
than 0.2 mm in a patient without symptoms 
or signs of metastases
M1
Distant detectable metastases as determined by 
classic clinical and radiographic means and/or 
histologically proven larger than 0.2 mm
 Posttreatment yp M classiﬁ cation.   The M category for patients 
treated with neoadjuvant therapy is the category assigned in 
the clinical stage, prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. 
Identiﬁ cation of distant metastases after the start of therapy 
in cases where pretherapy evaluation showed no metastases is 
considered progression of disease. If a patient was designated 
to have detectable distant metastases (M1) before chemother-
apy, the patient will be designated as M1 throughout.

 Complete 
response 
(CR) 
 Pathologic complete response can only be 
determined by histopathologic evaluation 
and is deﬁ ned by the absence of invasive 
carcinoma in the breast and lymph nodes. 
 Residual in situ cancer, in the absence of 
invasive disease, constitutes a pCR. 
 Patients with isolated tumor foci in lymph 
nodes are not classiﬁ ed as having a CR. The 
presence of axillary nodal tumor deposits 
of any size, including cell clusters less than 
or equal to 0.2 mm, excludes a complete 
response. These patients will be catego-
rized as ypN0(i+). 
 Partial 
response 
(PR) 
 A decrease in either or both the T or N cat-
egory compared to the pretreatment T or N, 
and no increase in either T or N. After che-
motherapy, one should use the method that 
most clearly deﬁ ned tumor dimensions at 
baseline for this comparison, although pre-
chemotherapy pT cannot be measured. 
 Clinical (pretreatment) T will be deﬁ ned 
by clinical and radiographic ﬁ ndings. y 
pathologic (posttreatment) T will be deter-
mined by pathologic size and extension. 
 Nodal response should be determined by 
physical examination or radiologic evalu-
ation, if the nodes are palpable or visible 
before chemotherapy. If prechemotherapy 
pathologic lymph node involvement is 
demonstrated by ﬁ ne needle aspiration, core 
biopsy, or sentinel node biopsy, it should 
be recorded as such. Absence of posttreat-
ment pathologic nodal involvement should 
be used to document pathologic complete 
response, and should be recorded, but does 
not necessarily represent a true “response” 
since one does not know whether lymph 
nodes removed surgically postchemother-
apy were involved prior to chemotherapy. 
 No response 
(NR) 
 No apparent change in either the T or N 
categories compared to the clinical (pre-
treatment) assignment or an increase in 
the T or N category at the time of y patho-
logic evaluation. 
 Clinical (pretreatment) T will be deﬁ ned

 SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
EVIDENCE-BASED CHANGES TO THE  AJCC 
CANCER STAGING MANUAL , SEVENTH EDITION 
 Revisit of Considerations Between Fifth and Sixth 
Editions 
 Q: Should histologic grade (Nottingham combined histologic 
grade recommended) be incorporated into the TNM classiﬁ ca-
tion system? 
 A: No; see “Considerations” below; T category . 
 Q: Should the classiﬁ cation of pathologic lymph node status 
in node-negative patients be ampliﬁ ed to include information 
about isolated tumor cells detected by immunohistochemical 
techniques? 
 A: Yes, in part and now further clariﬁ ed; see “Considerations” 
below; N category 
 Q: Should micrometastases (pN1mi) detected by immunohis-
tochemical staining and not veriﬁ ed by H&E staining be clas-
siﬁ ed as pN1? 
 A: Yes; see “Considerations” below; N category. The deﬁ ni-
tion is now based on size, NOT how they were detected. 
 Q: Should size criteria be used to distinguish between isolated 
tumor cells and micrometastases? 
 A: Yes; see “Considerations” below; N category. The deﬁ ni-
tion is now based on size, NOT how they were detected. 
 Q: How should RT-PCR be used in the detection of small tumor 
deposits? 
 A: If collected, it should be collected by the registrar, but not 
used for staging; see “Considerations” below; N category 
 Q: Should the classiﬁ cation of pathologic lymph node status 
in node-positive (all nodes with deposits greater than 0.2 mm) 
patients be changed to reﬂ ect more clearly the prognostic signiﬁ -
cance of number of affected nodes? 
 A: It was changed in sixth edition; no change in seventh 
edition. 
 Q: Should a ﬁ nding of positive internal mammary lymph nodes 
retain a current classiﬁ cation of N3? 
 A: It was reclassiﬁ ed pN2b in the sixth edition. In the seventh 
edition, if positive internal mammary lymph nodes are iden-
tiﬁ ed in the absence of axillary lymph node positivity, then it 
is classiﬁ ed N2b. If positive lymph nodes are identiﬁ ed in the 
presence of axillary lymph node positivity, then it is classiﬁ ed 
N3b. 
 Q: Should a ﬁ nding of positive supraclavicular lymph nodes be 
classiﬁ ed as N3 rather than M1? 
 A: It was reclassiﬁ ed pN3 from M1 in the sixth edition. No 
change in the seventh edition. 
 Q: Are there other prognostic factors that are powerful enough 
to consider for inclusion in the TNM grading system? 
 A: No. See “Considerations” below; B category regarding 
multiparameter assays. 
 New Considerations Between Sixth and Seventh 
Editions.   The Breast Cancer Task Force deliberated many 
important issues regarding the TNM staging system for the 
seventh edition. These can be divided into subtle, but impor-
tant changes in rules regulating how to collect or interpret 
already existing factors, such as T, N, and M, and whether new 
markers and/or technologies should be incorporated into any 
of these categories. The following discussions highlight these

considerations and justify the changes that have been recom-
mended. 
 Of note, the Breast Cancer Task Force did not feel that any 
new factors have reached a level of evidence to justify inclu-
sion into the staging system. Indeed, a literature search using 
the terms “breast cancer” and “prognostic factors” yielded over 
1,800 publications in the English literature during the 5-year 
period 2003–2007. These factors included ethnic origin, pre- 
and post-diagnostic life styles and body habitus, means of 
diagnosis and apparent radiographic character of the tumor, 
germ line polymorphisms in candidate genes related to tumor 
behavior and/or distribution and activity of therapeutic agents, 
somatic biologic changes in the primary cancer, and evidence 
of distant, microscopic metastases using sensitive radiographic, 
molecular, and cellular detection systems. In most, if not all 
of these studies, the authors conclude that the investigational 
factor was statistically signiﬁ cantly associated with outcome. 
However, the studies were often conducted using datasets and 
tissue specimens that were conveniently available rather than 
as prospective, well-designed investigations. Importantly, the 
effects of systemic therapy, either in the adjuvant or metastatic 
settings, were often ignored or not even considered. Therefore, 
one is unable to determine if differential outcomes between 
those patients who were positive vs. those who were negative 
occurred because of, or in spite of, the marker. Such consid-
erations must be taken into account in the design, conduct, 
analysis, and reporting of tumor marker studies. 24 – 30  
 Primary Tumor (T) 
 Should histologic grade (Nottingham combined histologic 
grade recommended) be incorporated into the TNM classi-
ﬁ cation system? 
 As noted, the issue of inclusion of histologic grade was very 
seriously considered by the Breast Cancer Task Force in prep-
aration of the sixth edition. Ultimately, after careful delibera-
tion of all of the identiﬁ ed published literature on the subject, 
the Task Force elected not to include grade as a stage modify-
ing factor in the TNM system. 23 The Task Force acknowledged 
the consistent differences in outcomes between women whose 
tumors were grade 1 vs. those that were grade 3, using the 
modiﬁ ed Scarff–Bloom–Richardson scoring system. How-
ever, the majority of breast cancers are classiﬁ ed as grade 2, 
and the prognostic signiﬁ cance of this category inconsistently 
tracked with either of the other two grades, depending on the 
study. Moreover, persistent concerns about grading inconsis-
tency between observers contributed to the decision not to 
include grade. 
 Several new studies have been published since the sixth 
edition, but none has clariﬁ ed the issue any further than what 
were available to the Task Force at that time. Additionally, sev-
eral authors have addressed speciﬁ c molecular components of 
grade, such as proliferative markers and multigene expression 
arrays that appear to reﬂ ect grade. 31 – 33 However, these assays 
are either not widely available, or, like standard histopatho-
logic analyses, reproducibility has been an issue. However, the 
Task Force does recommend collection of tumor grade, using 
the standardized Nottingham combined histologic score with 
calibrated mitotic counts, for inclusion in registry databases.
 Should T4 be distilled to inﬂ ammatory carcinoma only?  
 Recent studies have suggested that the T4 designation should 
be restricted to inﬂ ammatory carcinoma (T4d) only, with the 
consideration that T4 a, b, and c categories have outcomes 
similar to those in the T3 category, and substantially better 
than those with true inﬂ ammatory breast cancer, if carefully 
deﬁ ned. 34 – 36 In this case, the other subcategories (T4a, T4b, 
T4c) would then be categorized based on the size of the tumor 
in each case, regardless of skin or chest wall involvement. 
 The Breast Cancer Task Force concluded that the data from 
the main study suggesting this change were interesting, but size 
of the study was modest and the analyses were not comprehen-
sive. Therefore, the Task Force requested an analysis of 5-year 
survival rates in T4 lesions in the National Cancer Database 
from 1998 to 2000. In this analysis of 9,865 cases, signiﬁ cantly 
different outcomes were observed for each of the T4 categories 
(T4a = 47%, T4b = 40%, T4c = 28%, T4d = 34%;  p < 0.0001 all 
pair-wise comparisons). However, without a comprehensive 
comparison to tumors of similar size/stage but <T4, the Task 
Force could not conclude that restricting T4 to T4d was appro-
priate. The group concluded that the data were insufﬁ cient at 
this time to recommend a change, but that they do warrant fur-
ther study and future consideration.
 Should the term “inﬂ ammatory carcinoma” be restricted to 
cases with typical clinical skin changes AND the presence of 
histologically conﬁ rmed invasive carcinoma involving der-
mal lymphatics? 
 The Task Force carefully considered this issue and elected not 
to recommend changes in the seventh edition. The deﬁ nition 
of inﬂ ammatory breast cancer will remain clinical and does 
not require the ﬁ nding of dermal lymphatic involvement, 
although it does, of course, require histologic conﬁ rmation of 
cancer either in breast parenchyma or skin. Dermal lymphatic 
involvement supports the diagnosis of inﬂ ammatory breast 
cancer but is not necessary, nor is it sufﬁ cient, in the absence 
of classical clinical ﬁ ndings, for the diagnosis of inﬂ amma-
tory breast cancer. The Task Force acknowledges that this rec-
ommendation is not based so much on new data but rather 
a perceived need to clarify the deﬁ nition in the sixth edition, 
which was considered ambiguous.
 Should the size of multiple separate ipsilateral tumors be 
taken into account when determining T category and Stage?  
 In prior editions of the  Staging Manual , T stage assignment 
for patients with multiple, concurrent ipsilateral breast can-
cers has been based only on the largest tumor, and the sum 
of the sizes has not been used. Although some studies suggest 
that multiple tumors may have a somewhat worse progno-
sis than single tumors in the same T category, the data are 
insufﬁ cient to change the current rules for staging. 37 How-
ever, the presence and sizes of the smaller tumor(s) should be 
recorded. The Breast Cancer Task Force does express concern 
about this issue and suggests it warrants further study.

 Regional Lymph Nodes (N) 
 Should the size thresholds for isolated tumor cell clusters 
and micrometastases be changed from the current limits of 
0.2 and 2.0 mm? 
 The prognostic signiﬁ cance of axillary metastases above a 2.0-
mm threshold was conﬁ rmed by two studies reported over 3 
decades ago. 38 , 39  Following the ﬁ rst study, a subcategory for 
micrometastases was added to the  Cancer Staging Manual . 
The introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy and wide-
spread use of immunohistochemistry facilitated detection of 
minimal disease in axillary lymph nodes and the sixth edition 
of the  Staging Manual established a lower limit for microme-
tastases of >0.2 mm creating a new category of minimal nodal 
disease. This limit was ten times smaller than the upper limit 
for micrometastases and had been tested in one retrospective 
study of occult metastases. 40 It was not a limit based on ﬁ rm 
medical evidence and should be periodically reevaluated. 
 Testing these thresholds is not an easy task. Doing so 
requires excluding the presence of metastases above the sug-
gested threshold prior to comparing differences in outcome for 
subgroups with smaller metastases, and then either accepting 
the confounding effects of systemic therapy or identifying data-
sets of untreated patients. To date, no study has evaluated dif-
ferences in disease free or overall survival for metastases above 
and below a 1.0-mm threshold after excluding all metastases 
above 2.0 mm. When these data become available, the upper 
limit of 2.0 mm for micrometastases could be reconsidered. 
 Evaluating the upper limit for isolated tumor cell clusters 
is more problematic because it requires excluding all patients 
with metastases larger than 0.2 mm prior to comparing sub-
groups with metastases below this threshold. Creating a “true 
node negative” comparison group is probably not practical 
with standard histologic techniques. In other words, any “node 
negative” group will contain some patients with occult meta-
static disease. Two limiting principles emerge when evaluating 
these thresholds; the ﬁ rst is lymph node sectioning strategies 
and the second is section screening. The possibility of miss-
ing a metastasis is proportional to the thickness of unexamined 
tissue, the number of sections examined, and the capability of 
the slide screening system to detect disease. 41 – 44 For example, 
if evaluation of serial sections from a lymph node is negative, 
but if a pathologist leaves 1.0 mm of unexamined tissue in the 
parafﬁ n lymph node block, one can only conclude that there 
is no metastasis larger than 1.0 mm; there is no guarantee the 
node does not contain occult disease. Single cells are routinely 
detected on histologic sections, but metastases as large as 
0.1 mm may be missed by a pathologist screening slides. 43 , 44  
 It has been theorized that isolated tumor cell clusters 
should be distinguishable from micrometastases on the basis 
of metastatic characteristics, such as proliferation or stromal 
reaction, and indeed this observation was included in the sixth 
edition. 23 , 45 However, in consideration of the seventh edition, 
the Breast Cancer Task Force perceived that this distinction 
can be highly subjective and expressed concern that replica-
tion among pathologists and among institutions may be dif-
ﬁ cult. For the seventh edition, the Breast Cancer Task Force 
continues to deﬁ ne isolated tumor cell clusters as not greater 
than 0.2 mm in diameter and micrometastases as greater than 
0.2 mm and not greater than 2.0 mm in diameter. However, 
the Task Force has recommended additional stringency to the 
isolated tumor cell cluster (ITC) category. A 0.2-mm metas-
tasis contains approximately 1,000 tumor cells and a 2.0-mm 
metastasis contains approximately one million tumor cells. 
The use of 0.2 mm as a lower limit was selected because it 
signiﬁ cantly reduces the likelihood that ITCs will be recorded 
as micrometastases without making it necessary to estimate 
actual cell number counts in ITCs. However, pathologists have 
had difﬁ culty applying the size criterion when a large number 
of nonconﬂ uent tumor cells are present in a lymph node such 
as may occur in some invasive lobular carcinomas. 46 For this 
reason, additional guidance has been incorporated in this edi-
tion. When more than 200 nonconﬂ uent or nearly conﬂ uent 
tumor cells are present in a single histologic cross section of a 
lymph node, there is a high probability that more than 1,000 
cells are present in the node, that the cumulative volume of 
these cells exceeds the volume of an ITC, and the node should 
be classiﬁ ed as containing a micrometastasis. The classiﬁ ca-
tion of patients with metastatic tumor deposits no greater 
than 0.2 mm as pN0 is consistent with the low recurrence 
rates typically seen in this patient group. The use of 2.0 mm as 
an upper size limit for micrometastases, originally proposed 
by Huvos and colleagues in 1971, is consistent with standards 
already used in the AJCC staging system. 38 These thresholds 
are meant to be guidelines, and not absolute cutoffs, to help 
pathologists determine if the tumor burden in a given lymph 
node is likely to be clinically important or not. The pathologist 
should use judgment, and not an absolute cutoff of 0.2 mm 
or exactly 200 cells, in determining the likelihood of whether 
the cluster of cells is an ITC or a true micrometastasis. 
 There is signiﬁ cant theoretic overlap in nodal tumor bur-
den at the upper limit of the ITC category and the lower limit 
of the micrometastasis category that is due to practical and 
economic constraints in the pathologic evaluation of lymph 
nodes. After considering these limitations in lymph node 
examination and the absence of outcome data on clinical 
signiﬁ cance of isolated tumor cell clusters and micrometasta-
ses  after systematic exclusion of macrometastases, the Breast 
Cancer Task Force perceived no compelling reason to change 
the current thresholds.
 Should nodal micrometastases be considered different from 
nodal macrometastases for purposes of overall stage grouping? 
 The  AJCC Cancer Staging Manual has traditionally grouped 
breast cancer cases with exclusively nodal micrometastases 
(pN1mi) as having the same prognostic signiﬁ cance as mac-
rometastases with respect to assigning an overall stage group-
ing based on T, N, and M categorical classiﬁ cations. A recent 
analysis of data in the United States Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology, and End Results (SEER) national cancer database has 
demonstrated that when nodal tumor deposits no larger than 
2.0 mm are the only ﬁ nding in lymph nodes and the primary 
tumor is less than or equal to 2 cm (pT1) the incremental 
decrease in survival at 5 and 10 years was only 1% compared

to patients with no nodal metastases detected. 47  Patients with 
tumors no larger than 2.0 cm (T1) represented 70% of the 
total population in the analysis, and in this subset calculated 
10-year survival decreased from 78% to 77% to 73% for pN0, 
pN1mi, and pN1a, respectively. This does not justify classify-
ing pN1mi cases with Stage II tumors. This analysis included 
data from 1992 to 2003 spanning the introduction and wide-
spread adoption of sentinel lymph node biopsy. In this edi-
tion of the manual, T1 tumors with nodal micrometastases 
(pN1mi) will be classiﬁ ed as Stage IB to indicate the better 
prognosis for the subset of breast cancer patients and to facili-
tate further investigation.
 How should RT-PCR be classiﬁ ed in the detection of nodal 
tumor deposits?    
 An even ﬁ ner level of resolution in the detection of isolated 
tumor cells and micrometastases is available with the use of 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
This technique was able to identify epithelial markers in a sig-
niﬁ cant percentage of sentinel nodes that were negative for 
disease by both histologic and immunohistochemical stain-
ing. 48 This is not surprising given that RT-PCR is theoretically 
capable of identifying single cells. However, it seems unlikely 
that minimal tumor burden would be as signiﬁ cant as clinically 
detected disease or macrometastases. Furthermore, because 
lymph node tissue is digested and consumed in preparation 
for RT-PCR, it is technically challenging to determine the exact 
size of the original metastatic focus. RT-PCR assays have been 
offered as an adjunct to standard histological analysis of sen-
tinel lymph node biopsy to assist in intraoperative decision 
making regarding the performance of completion axillary 
node dissection. 49 The prognostic or staging signiﬁ cance of 
such RT-PCR assay results remains unclear. There is evidence 
that such highly-sensitive tests produce false positive results 
despite efforts to calibrate RT-PCR results with traditional his-
tologic measurements. 41 Correlation between RT-PCR testing 
and histology has been performed but there is continued and 
justiﬁ ed concern that RT-PCR assays do not provide the same 
data as routine histologic measurement and categorization of 
nodal metastases. A lymph node that is exclusively positive by 
molecular assay alone (mol+) may contain isolated tumor cell 
clusters, micrometastases, macrometastases, or be a false posi-
tive result due to sampling, contamination, or features intrin-
sic to the assay. Presently, there are insufﬁ cient data to suggest 
that RT-PCR assay of lymph nodes should replace or substitute 
for traditional histologic evaluation of lymph nodes. Staging 
is further complicated when some nodes or portions of some 
nodes are evaluated by RT-PCR and other nodes are evaluated 
by histology. 
 Pending further developments in this area, this edition of 
the  AJCC Cancer Staging Manual will continue to classify any 
lesion identiﬁ ed by RT-PCR alone as pN0 for the purposes 
of staging. In addition, any case that is histologically negative 
for regional lymph node metastases and in which examina-
tion for epithelial markers was made with RT-PCR and the 
examination was considered positive will have the appended 
designation (mol+). It is recommended that the ﬁ rst priority 
in evaluating lymph nodes is histologic identiﬁ cation of mac-
rometastases (metastases larger than 2.0 mm). Thus, it is not 
recommended to divert portions of nodal tissue for molec-
ular analysis that might contain a macrometastasis. When 
lymph nodes contain tumor deposits detected by histologic 
evaluation and molecular techniques, N classiﬁ cation based 
on histologic ﬁ ndings and measurements is utilized. 
 Distant Metastases (M) 
    How should circulating tumor cells or microscopic tumor 
cells be handled in the absence of overt clinical ﬁ nding? 
 Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and microscopic tumor cells 
detected in the bone marrow are collectively designated as 
DTCs. Several studies have shown a relationship between bone 
marrow DTCs and recurrence risk and mortality in M0 stage 
breast cancer. 50 , 51 However, the Breast Cancer Task Force con-
cluded that although the presence of positive bone marrow 
micrometastases has been statistically signiﬁ cantly associated 
with worse outcomes, the difference in recurrence and mortal-
ity rates between patients who have them and those who do not 
was not sufﬁ ciently large to recommend a change in the M stag-
ing system. In particular, patients who already have a favorable 
prognosis (T1, N0) do not appear to have a substantially worse 
outcome if they have positive bone marrow micrometastases. 50  
 Although several recent studies have suggested that CTC 
are commonly detected in patients with early stage breast 
cancer and may be prognostic, the Task Force concluded that 
most of these studies were small with short follow-up and 
were confounded by the effects of systemic therapy. 2 , 28 , 52 – 60 
 In summary, the designation of M1 has generally been 
used to determine a relative, or even, absolute state of incur-
ability. Thus, many clinicians revert to a philosophy of pal-
liative, rather than curative intent, for patients who are 
designated M1. There are no data to suggest that detection of 
DTCs in any tissue (bone marrow, ovary, blood) in the absence 
of clinical and/or radiographic ﬁ ndings confers incurability. 
Therefore, the Task Force recommends that in the absence of 
overt metastases detected by clinical examination or imaging 
abnormalities, DTCs should not affect M staging. 
 The Task Force has recommended that, for data collec-
tion purposes, the DTC designation should be expanded 
to include any cluster of malignant cells not greater than 
0.2 mm found in any tissue outside of the breast and sur-
rounding regional lymph nodes in the absence of clinical 
or radiographic signs of metastases. DTC assessment is not 
required or recommended as part of staging at the cur-
rent time outside of the investigational setting in patients 
with clinical M0 disease. However, if DTCs are detected, the 
staging category should be denoted as M0(i+) and the data 
should be collected by the registrars.
 Should DTC (bone marrow micrometastases or CTC) be 
incorporated to subdivide the M1 category? 
 The Task Force considered whether the TNM system might be 
used to further subdivide patients with M1 disease. In patients 
with overt metastases (M1), the presence and number of CTCs

at the time of diagnosis have been shown to be prognostic for 
both disease progression and mortality. 51 , 58 , 61 – 67 Changes in 
CTCs after treatment are also predictive of response to ther-
apy and prognostic for recurrence and mortality, although 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology Tumor Marker 
Guidelines Panel has not recommended routine use of CTC in 
management of patients with metastatic breast cancer, since 
the utility of this assay in patient management decisions has 
not been demonstrated. 2  After careful deliberation, the Task 
Force decided that the TNM system has not, in the past, dealt 
with prognosis in those patients with established, clinically 
or radiographically detectable metastases, and the Task Force 
elected not to recommend that CTC presence or number be 
used to further subclassify M1 staging. 
 y Pathologic (Postneoadjuvant) Systemic Therapy 
 Why add a postneoadjuvant systemic therapy staging system?  
 Neoadjuvant therapy, also designated preoperative, presurgi-
cal, or primary adjuvant systemic therapy, has been increas-
ingly studied and applied for patients with operable, as well 
as traditionally inoperable breast cancer. 68 While most com-
monly considered for chemotherapy, neo- or preoperative 
adjuvant endocrine therapy has also been studied extensively. 68 
The increasing importance of this strategy mandates that the 
staging system provide the information necessary to assess 
prognosis in this diverse group of patients. Clearly, outcomes 
after neoadjuvant systemic therapy differ among patients, so 
that a staging system should reﬂ ect potential prognosis. Thus, 
the Breast Cancer Task Force has included a staging system to 
be applied for patients treated in this manner, which will be 
designated with the preﬁ x y, y pathologic or yp, in accordance 
with AJCC policy in other disease sites.
 What is the proper deﬁ nition of complete response after neo-
adjuvant systemic therapy? 
 The prognostic importance of a histologic complete response 
(CR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was ﬁ rst documented in 
patients with locally advanced breast cancer. 69 This obser-
vation was subsequently conﬁ rmed in randomized trials 
involving patients with operable disease. 70 In several studies, 
a variety of different deﬁ nitions of CR have been employed, 
making a comparison of the outcomes of different treatment 
regimens difﬁ cult. For this reason, the Task Force proposed a 
standard set of response deﬁ nitions to be included with the 
posttreatment stage. 
 Although an international expert panel proposed that 
a CR be deﬁ ned as the absence of invasive and  noninvasive 
tumor in the breast, 71 the Task Force recommends that the 
AJCC deﬁ nition of CR should be the absence of invasive car-
cinoma in the breast and the axillary nodes, since the presence 
of noninvasive cancer, while important in the selection of 
local therapy, is not a determinant of survival. A retrospective 
review from the MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the 
outcome of 78 patients with a pathologic CR and no residual 
tumor of any kind to that of 199 patients with residual DCIS 
only and 2,025 patients with residual invasive cancer. The 5 
and 10 year disease-free and overall survival rates for patients 
with a pathologic CR with and without DCIS did not differ 
signiﬁ cantly, but were signiﬁ cantly better than the survival 
rates of patients with invasive cancer. 72  Similar ﬁ ndings were 
reported by Jones et al. in a study of 435 patients. 73 
 What is the optimal method of determining T after neoadju-
vant systemic therapy? 
 An unresolved problem in deﬁ ning the yp posttreatment stage 
is how to determine the best method for measuring tumor size 
after neoadjuvant/preoperative chemotherapy. In the absence 
of a CR, the assessment of the extent of response in the tumor 
and the measurement of tumor size remain problematic. Par-
tial response in the NSABP protocol B18 74 and in the grading 
system proposed by Chevillard et al. 75 is identiﬁ ed by nests of 
tumor in a desmoplastic or ﬁ brotic stroma. In contrast, the 
Miller–Payne grading system 76 and a system used at the M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center 77  rely upon loss of cellularity to 
describe the degree of response. No single method of assessing 
response has been shown to be a superior predictor of outcome, 
and concerns about reproducibility exist for all these measures. 
The combination of tumor size and an assessment of changes 
in cellularity are useful in documenting pathologic evidence of 
response. However, pretreatment biopsies are not always avail-
able to the pathologist assessing the posttreatment specimen. 
For this reason, the Breast Cancer Task Force has deﬁ ned the 
pathologic T size by the largest contiguous tumor focus, with 
a sufﬁ x to alert the clinician when multiple scattered tumor 
foci are observed. When nests of tumor cells in ﬁ brotic stroma 
are observed posttreatment, the T should be determined based 
on the largest contiguous area of invasive carcinoma, exclud-
ing surrounding areas of ﬁ brosis. This method of T determi-
nation has been shown to correlate with survival in the study 
of Carey et al. 78 Additional information that is important for 
planning local therapy such as the distance over which the 
tumor extends (when scattered foci are present) or the number 
of slides/blocks in which tumor is seen should be included in 
the pathology report, but is not part of TNM.
 How should isolated tumor cells be considered after neoad-
juvant therapy? 
 In patients who have not received neoadjuvant therapy, nodes 
with ITCs are classiﬁ ed pN0, reﬂ ecting uncertainty about their 
prognostic signiﬁ cance. After neoadjuvant therapy, ITCs could 
represent the presence of minimal nodal disease pre-treatment 
which did not respond to therapy or the remnants of macro-
scopic nodal disease which has had a partial response. Until 
further data are available to address the prognostic signiﬁ cance 
of ITCs post-treatment, the presence of ITC precludes classify-
ing the patient as having a complete response to therapy. How-
ever, these patients will be classiﬁ ed as ypN0(i+) to maintain 
standard deﬁ nitions throughout the TNM system.
 Should the same considerations be used for preoperative 
endocrine (anti-estrogen) or other targeted therapy?  
 The overwhelming majority of the available information 
regarding the prognostic signiﬁ cance of CR comes from

patients treated with chemotherapy. Limited information 
is available about the prognostic signiﬁ cance of the degree 
of response when targeted therapies directed against ER 
or HER2 are used. Pathologic CR is rarely seen in patients 
receiving 3–4 months of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, 
and its absence should not be considered evidence of endo-
crine resistance or poor prognosis. 79 , 80 Complete response in 
patients overexpressing HER2 and treated with trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy was associated with a signiﬁ cant sur-
vival improvement compared with that in women who did 
not have pathologic CR. 81 Additional information regarding 
the relationship between response and survival is needed for 
the newer targeted therapies, and therefore the Breast Cancer 
Task Force recommends collection of postneoadjuvant ther-
apy TNM data by the registrars.
 What are the difﬁ culties in evaluating partial response?    
 The Breast Cancer Task Force recognizes that the deﬁ nition 
of partial response (PR), requiring a decrease in the T or N 
category, may fail to capture some patients with a reduc-
tion in tumor volume. However, modalities such as physical 
examination, mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, which 
may be used to determine the clinical (pretreatment) tumor 
size, have been demonstrated to signiﬁ cantly overestimate 
and underestimate the extent of tumor when compared with 
pathologic examination, 82 making deﬁ nitions of response 
based on small changes in the clinically determined pretreat-
ment tumor size compared to the y pathologic posttreatment 
tumor size potentially inaccurate. In this regard, the most 
accurate predictor of outcome after neoadjuvant chemother-
apy is pathologic complete response. 68 , 79 However, a rough 
estimate of response should be determined comparing post-
treatment clinical, radiographic, and pathologic assessments 
with those made prior to initiation of systemic therapy, and 
this should be recorded.
 Should TNM stage prior to neoadjuvant systemic (clinical 
stage) be considered in y pathologic posttreatment staging? 
 An increasing body of data suggests that prognosis after neo-
adjuvant therapy is determined by the posttreatment patho-
logic stage, degree of response, and the pretreatment stage. 
Carey et al. demonstrated that the AJCC TNM posttreatment 
(yp) stage was a signiﬁ cant predictor of both 5-year disease-
free and overall survival. 78 However, even in patients with a 
pathologic CR, the clinical TNM at presentation provides 
valuable prognostic information. In a group of 226 patients 
treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and having a 
pathologic CR to neoadjuvant therapy, statistically signiﬁ cant 
differences in the 10-year metastases-free survival were noted 
on the basis of stage at presentation. 83 Similar ﬁ ndings were 
noted for locoregional recurrence (LRR), with patients with 
clinical Stage I or II disease and a pathologic CR to neoadju-
vant therapy having a 0% 10-year incidence of LRR without 
radiation therapy compared with 33% for those with clinical 
Stage III disease and a pathologic CR treated without radio-
therapy. 10 The relative importance of pretreatment stage, 
posttreatment stage, and degree of response in predicting 
survival remains to be deﬁ ned, and therefore the Task Force 
does not recommend inclusion of pretreatment TNM data 
in calculating a posttreatment stage (“yp”), unless the patient 
was M1 prior to initiation of therapy. In this case, her M sta-
tus is considered M1 regardless of response to therapy. How-
ever, the Task Force does recommend inclusion of response 
in the data routinely collected in patients receiving neoadju-
vant therapy and the deﬁ nition of the method of determining 
pretreatment nodal status will allow these relationships to be 
more carefully assessed.

*Note: Invasion of the dermis alone does not qualify as T4.
**Note: Inflammatory carcinoma is restricted to cases with typical skin changes

invasive carcinoma invading dermal lymphatics is supportive of the diagnosis, it is not 
required, nor is dermal lymphatic invasion without typical clinical findings sufficient for a 
diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer.

Metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes
*Classification is based on axillary lymph node dissection with or without sentinel lymph
node biopsy. Classification based solely on sentinel lymph node biopsy without subse-
quent axillary lymph node dissection is designated (sn) for “sentinel node,” for example, pN0(sn).
**Note: Not clinically detected is defined as not detected by imaging studies
(excluding lymphoscintigraphy) or not detected by clinical examination.
***Note: Clinically detected is defined as detected by imaging studies (excluding  
lymphoscintigraphy) or by clinical examination and having characteristics highly
suspicious for malignancy or a presumed pathologic macrometastasis based on
fine needle aspiration biopsy with cytologic examination. Confirmation of clinically
detected metastatic disease by fine needle aspiration without excision biopsy is
designated with an (f) suffix, for example, cN3a(f). Excisional biopsy of a lymph node
or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is classified as
a clinical N, for example, cN1. Information regarding the confirmation of the nodal status
will be designated in sitespecific factors as clinical, fine needle aspiration, core biopsy,
or sentinel lymph node biopsy. Pathologic classification (pN) is used for excision or
sentinel lymph node biopsy only in conjunction with a pathologic T assignment.
Note: Isolated tumor cell clusters (ITC) are defined as small clusters of cells not
greater than 0.2 mm, or single tumor cells, or a cluster of fewer than 200 cells in
a single histologic cross-section. ITCs may be detected by routine histology or by
immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. Nodes containing only ITCs are excluded 
from the total positive node count for purposes of N classification but should be
included in the total number of nodes evaluated

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
No clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastases (no pathologic M0; 
use clinical M to complete stage group)
No clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastases, but deposits of 
molecularly or microscopically detected tumor cells in circulating blood, 
bone marrow or other non-regional nodal tissue that are no larger than  
0.2 mm in a patient without symptoms or signs of metastases
Distant detectable metastases as determined by classic clinical and 
radiographic means and/or histologically proven larger than 0.2 mm

General Notes: 
For identification of special cases of 
TNM or pTNM classifications, the "m" 
suffix and "y," "r," and "a" prefixes are 
used. Although they do not affect the 
stage grouping, they indicate cases 
needing separate analysis.
m suffix indicates the presence of 
multiple primary tumors in a single 
site and is recorded in parentheses: 
pT(m)NM.
y prefix indicates those cases in 
which classification is performed 
during or following initial multimodality 
therapy. The cTNM or pTNM 
category is identified by a "y" prefix. 
The ycTNM or ypTNM categorizes 
the extent of tumor actually present at 
the time of that examination. The "y" 
categorization is not an estimate of 
tumor prior to multimodality therapy.
r prefix indicates a recurrent tumor 
when staged after a disease-free 
interval, and is identified by the "r" 
prefix: rTNM.
a prefix designates the stage 
determined at autopsy: aTNM.

Residual Tumor (R)
The absence or presence of residual tumor after treatment. In some cases treated with surgery and/or 
with neoadjuvant therapy there will be residual tumor at the primary site after treatment because of 
incomplete resection or local and regional disease that extends beyond the limit of ability of resection.
RX Presence of residual tumor cannot be assessed
R0 No residual tumor
R1 Microscopic residual tumor

ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTORS
Lymphatic Vessel Invasion (L) and Venous Invasion (V) have been combined into Lymph-Vascular 
Invasion (LVI) for collection by cancer registrars. The College of American Pathologist (CAP) Checklist 
should be used as the primary source. Other sources may be used in the absence of a Checklist. Priority 
is given to positive results.

surgical margins  is data field 
recorded by registrars describing the 
surgical margins of the resected 
primary site specimen as determined 
only by the pathology report. 
neoadjuvant treatment is radiation 
therapy or systemic therapy 
(consisting of chemotherapy, 
hormone therapy, or immunotherapy) 
administered prior to a definitive 
surgical procedure. If the surgical 
procedure is not performed, the 
administered therapy no longer meets 
the definition of neoadjuvant therapy.
